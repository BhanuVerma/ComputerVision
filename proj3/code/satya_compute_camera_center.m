% Returns the camera center matrix for a given projection matrix

% 'M' is the 3x4 projection matrix
% 'Center' is the 1x3 matrix of camera center location in world coordinates

function [ Center ] = compute_camera_center( M )

m4=M(:,4);
Q=M(:,1:3);
Center=-inv(Q)*m4;
%In the visualization you will see that this camera location is clearly
%incorrect, placing it in the center of the room where it would not see all
%of the points.
